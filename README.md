# odin-recipes
recipes 
This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished. But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML skills; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
